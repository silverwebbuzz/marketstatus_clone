        <p>
          Payment gateways are tools that help businesses accept money online
          safely and easily. They act like digital cashiers, making sure that
          money moves from the customer’s bank to the seller’s bank without any
          problems. In India, where many people are shopping online, picking the
          right Payment Processing Software is very important.

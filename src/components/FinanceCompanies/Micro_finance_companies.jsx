      <h1>11 Best Micro Finance Company In India</h1>
      <p>Microfinance term relates to a small amount of credit facility offered primarily to the low-income group, unbanked and marginalized people in rural and semi-urban areas</p>
      <p>The microloans support livelihoods in the rural areas where banks are very far and access to formal banking services is remote.</p> 
      <h2>What are Microfinance Companies </h2>  
      <p>Microfinance companies are non-banking finance (NBFC) companies registered with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that offer short term loans to people at lower interest rates than primary lenders.</p> 
      <p>Microfinance companies focus on rural or semi-urban areas where people need money urgently for a short time period usually for a period of 1 to 2 years. </p>
      <p>Microfinance companies on one hand work closely with women entrepreneurs for helping them start small tailoring shops, art and craft shops and local produce businesses. </p>
      <h2>Working Model of Microfinance Companies in India</h2>
      <h4>1. Self Help Group (SHG)</h4>
      <p>Self Help Group is an informal group of small entrepreneurs with similar socio-economic backgrounds. Small entrepreneurs including women come together to create a common fund to meet the emergency needs of their business. The SHG is a savings oriented group.</p>
      <p>They fix periodic meets, open an account with a microfinance company and save regularly in the fund, and when any group member needs funds, he gets that from the collective savings.</p>
      <p>These groups are generally non-profit self-sustaining organizations. The group itself takes care of the responsibility of debt recovery.</p>
      <p>Self-help groups get money on credit from the bank like NABARD and SIDBI once they become stable and present a track record of regular repayments of their borrowers.</p>
      <h4>2. Joint Liability Group (JLG)</h4>
      <p>Joint Liability Group concept for microfinance was started by NABARD. JLG is a group of 4-10 small farmers, rural entrepreneurs, people of the same village/locality having the same socioeconomic background.</p>
      <p>The JLG is formed with the purpose of availing loan from a microfinance company without any collateral. The JLG is for income generation, activity-oriented groups.</p>
      <p><strong>Microfinance companies can finance a JLG in two ways</strong></p>
      <p>Financing to the group directly</p>
      <p>Financing to the individual in the groups</p>

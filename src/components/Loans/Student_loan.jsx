            <h2>Introduction to Student Loans</h2>
            <p>
              Student loans are a critical financial resource that helps
              millions of students access higher education. With the rising
              costs of tuition, housing, and other college-related expenses,
              many students and their families turn to student loans to bridge
              the gap between what they can afford and the total cost of
              education.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two primary types of student loans: federal and private.
              Federal student loans are provided by the U.S. government and
              typically offer lower interest rates, more flexible repayment
              options, and benefits such as loan forgiveness programs. Private
              student loans, on the other hand, are offered by banks, credit
              unions, and other financial institutions and are often used to
              supplement federal loans when additional funds are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding the different types of student loans, their terms,
              and repayment options is essential for making informed decisions
              about financing your education. While student loans can provide
              the necessary funds to pursue a degree, they also represent a
              significant financial obligation that requires careful planning
              and management.

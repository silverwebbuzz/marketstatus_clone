              Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and a
              policyholder, where the insurer guarantees payment of a death
              benefit to named beneficiaries upon the death of the insured. This
              type of insurance is crucial for financial planning and
              protection, offering peace of mind that loved ones will be
              financially secure even in the policyholder's absence. By ensuring
              that beneficiaries receive a predetermined sum, life insurance
              helps to cover expenses such as mortgages, education, and daily
              living costs, making it an essential component of long-term
              financial security.
